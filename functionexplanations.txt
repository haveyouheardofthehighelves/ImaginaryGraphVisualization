functions: 
separate(list) "'" takes in list as a parameter and splits the list into its imaginary and real components. 
For instance, [a^2, 2*a*i, b^2] would return [a^2, b^2], [2a] i is already implied in second array and is therefore not needed."'"

split(list): "'"given an expression, terms are split based on + sign to be added again later, this is so we can focus on each term individually"'
rewrite_imaginary(list) "'" rewriting powers of i in terms to the simplest power, this is too make data more digestable as well as allowing for easier extraction
				    Ex: i^3, i^7,... i^4n +3 = -i
				    i^2, i^6, i^10... i^ 4n+2 = -1
				    i^4 , i^8, i^12... i^4n = 1
				    i, i^5, i^9...i^4n+1  = i "'"

separate(list): "'"takes in list as a parameter and splits the list into its imaginary and real components.

transform(pretrans) "'"transforms f(x) => f(ix) by taking every instance of a and b and muliplying it by i. Example: a^2 + 2ai + b^2 becomes (ai)^2 + 2(ai)i + (bi)^2"'"

importlibraries(string)
	"'"writes libraries needed to graph into given python file (numpy and matplotlib)"'" 
Write_graph(list, string, string)
	"'"takes in list and pyhton file, the list contains 1 term per index, terms are concatinated and graphed in seperate python file."'"
showplot(string)
	"'"enables plot to be shown, and executes seperate python file"'" 

rootsofunity(string)
	"'"after specifying root of unity, you can choose between states of rotation to see graphical images of transformed graphs for each interval "'"

angletransform(pretrans, oor)
	"'"given a root of unity and expression, angletransform calculates each transformed expression per root of unity interval, and return and array "'"

menuoptions()
	"'"enables user to interact with all features of application"'"
printmenu()
	"'"function to print menu"'"
instructions()
	''"prints instructions if -h argument used, or graph input incorrect"'"
