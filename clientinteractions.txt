how client interacts with it:
no argument specifed: Asks to input a function with polynomials a b and i
argument -h: Prints dialogue and informs client on how to use program


Options:
After inputting graph: 
1: 3d Visual representation of real part
2: 3d Visual representation of imaginary part
3: 3d Visual representation of transformed function (real part) via f(x) => f(ix) x = a,b
4: 3d Visual representation of transformed function (imaginary part) via f(x) => f(ix) x = a,b
5: Root of unity transformation based on fraction of rotation
	- once inputted, 2d array is made of all instances of graph for each cycle
		- user is then prompted to select one of states of the graph between 1 to F.O.R 
6: print options
q: quit program
